## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

### Learning Path
1. **Start with Introductory Call** - Get comfortable with initial conversations
2. **Master LeetCode Patterns** - Pick 2-3 patterns per week
   - Solve easy problems first
   - Progress to medium and hard
   - Focus on pattern recognition
3. **Practice System Design** - Start with simple designs, build complexity
4. **Prepare Behavioral Stories** - Write down 5-10 STAR stories
5. **Language Refresher** - Review syntax and idioms before interviews

### Daily Practice Routine
- **Week 1-4**: Focus on 3-4 LeetCode patterns + 2-3 problems per day
- **Week 5-8**: System design (backend, frontend, full-stack - 3-4 problems per week) + continued LeetCode practice
- **Week 9-10**: Hands-on projects from Technical Stack + review language-specific syntax and patterns
- **Week 11-12**: Mock interviews + behavioral prep + review weak areas
- **Ongoing**: Consistency is key - even 30 minutes daily makes a difference

### Interview Type Breakdown
- **Meta**: Behavioral + 2 coding + 1-2 system design
- **Google**: 4-5 coding rounds + 1 behavioral
- **Amazon**: 1 behavioral (heavy on leadership principles) + 2-3 coding + system design

## 💪 Learning by Doing Philosophy

This repository follows a **"learning by doing"** approach:
- **No passive reading** - Every concept has practical exercises
- **Spaced repetition** - Revisit patterns weekly
- **Progressive difficulty** - Build confidence from easy → hard
- **Real interview simulation** - Time yourself, explain out loud
