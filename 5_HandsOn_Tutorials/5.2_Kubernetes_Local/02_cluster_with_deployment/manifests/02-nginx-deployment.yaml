# Field Explanations:
# -----------------
# apiVersion: apps/v1 - Apps API group (for Deployments, StatefulSets, etc.)
# kind: Deployment - Resource type
# metadata.name - Name of the deployment
# metadata.labels - Labels for the deployment itself
#
# spec.replicas - Desired number of pod replicas
# spec.selector - How the deployment finds which pods to manage
# spec.selector.matchLabels - Pods must have ALL these labels to match
#
# spec.template - Pod template (blueprint for creating pods)
# spec.template.metadata.labels - Labels applied to created pods
#   IMPORTANT: Must match or include spec.selector.matchLabels
#
# spec.template.spec - Pod specification (same as Pod spec)
# spec.template.spec.containers - List of containers
#
# livenessProbe - Checks if container is alive (restarts if fails)
#   httpGet - HTTP GET request to specified path and port
#   initialDelaySeconds - Wait before first probe
#   periodSeconds - How often to perform probe
#
# readinessProbe - Checks if container is ready to serve traffic
#   If fails, pod removed from service endpoints
#
# Key Differences from Standalone Pod:
# 1. Has 'replicas' field
# 2. Has 'selector' to find managed pods
# 3. Uses 'template' to define pod specification
# 4. Supports rolling updates and rollbacks
# 5. Self-healing: recreates pods if they die
