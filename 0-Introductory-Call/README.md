## Self-Introduction & Elevator Pitch

Your elevator pitch is a 30-60 second summary that hooks the recruiter and sets the tone for the conversation.

### Key Components

1. **Name and Current Role**
2. **Core Skills/Expertise**
3. **Notable Achievement or Project**
4. **What You're Looking For**
5. **Why You're Interested in This Role**

### Example Elevator Pitch (Software Engineer)

**30-second version:**
> "Hi, I'm [Name]. I'm a full-stack engineer with 5 years of experience building scalable web applications. I've focused heavily on distributed systems and have led the architecture of several services that handle millions of requests daily. I'm particularly interested in this role because I want to work on problems that directly impact billions of users, and I've admired [Company]'s approach to scalability and reliability."

**45-second version (add technical depth):**
> "Hi, I'm [Name]. I'm a full-stack engineer with 5 years of experience at [Previous Company] building scalable web applications. I'm particularly passionate about system design - I've led the architecture of several microservices handling millions of requests daily, reducing latency by 40% and improving availability to 99.99%. I'm looking for a role where I can continue solving complex infrastructure problems at scale. Your company's focus on [specific initiative] really resonates with me, especially given the engineering challenges that come with [relevant challenge]."

### Pro Tips

- **Practice out loud**: Record yourself and listen. It should sound natural, not scripted
- **Customize for the company**: Research the company beforehand and mention specific products/initiatives
- **Avoid bragging**: Focus on impact and what you learned, not self-praise
- **Show enthusiasm**: Your tone matters as much as the words
- **Have multiple versions**: Short (30s), medium (45s), and long (2 min) versions ready

### Template

```
Hi, I'm [Name]. I'm a [role] with [X years] of experience [key context].
I've focused on [area of expertise] and achieved [quantifiable impact].
I'm looking for a role where [career goal]. I'm interested in [Company] because
[specific reason related to company's mission/tech/culture].
```

## Discussing Your Background & Experience

This is where you tell your story in a way that's relevant to the role.

### Structure Your Narrative

1. **Career Journey**: Walk through major roles (2-3 min)
2. **Impact & Results**: For each role, mention 2-3 key achievements
3. **Growth Areas**: Show how you've evolved technically and as a person
4. **Why You Left**: Always be positive about previous employers

### Example Narrative

**For Career Progression:**
> "I started at [Company A] as an engineer working on [area]. After two years, I became lead engineer for [project], where I built a team and shipped [major feature]. That success gave me confidence to move to [Company B], where I took on a larger scale problem - managing [infrastructure/system]. Over three years there, I grew from individual contributor to tech lead, managing a team of 5 engineers. Now I'm looking for the next challenge where I can apply both technical depth and leadership experience."

### Achievement Framework

Use **STAR** format, but keep it conversational:

- **Situation**: What was the challenge?
- **Task**: What did you own?
- **Action**: What did you specifically do?
- **Result**: What was the measurable impact?

**Example:**
> "We had a microservice that was experiencing P1 outages during peak traffic. I led the redesign effort, implementing rate limiting and caching strategies. Within 3 months, we reduced latency by 45% and eliminated cascading failures. That experience really shaped how I approach system design."

### Common Questions & How to Answer

**"Tell me about yourself"**
- This is NOT your resume. Keep it to 2-3 minutes
- Focus on career arc and relevant experience
- End by connecting it to the role you're applying for

**"What are your biggest strengths?"**
- Pick 2-3 that are relevant to the role
- Back them up with specific examples
- Be humble but confident

**"What's something you struggled with?"**
- Pick something you actually struggled with
- Show what you learned and how you overcame it
- Frame it as growth, not weakness

**Example answer:**
> "Early in my career, I wasn't great at communicating with non-technical stakeholders. I was too deep in the technical weeds. I recognized this in my first performance review and actively worked on it - I started attending product meetings, writing clear technical documentation, and practicing explaining complex concepts simply. Now I actually enjoy that cross-functional collaboration."

## Expressing Interest in the Company

Recruiters can tell if you're just collecting offers. Show genuine interest.

### Research Before the Call

1. **Product**: What does the company actually do? What problems does it solve?
2. **Recent News**: Major launches, acquisitions, partnerships?
3. **Engineering Blog**: What are they publicly working on?
4. **Team/Manager**: Look on LinkedIn if you know who your manager would be
5. **Culture**: What's their reputation? Values?

### How to Articulate Interest

**Weak:**
> "I've heard good things about your company. I'd like to work there."

**Strong:**
> "I've been really impressed by your work on [specific project]. I use [product] daily, and recently read your blog post on [technical challenge]. The way you approached [problem] aligns with how I think about [relevant area]. I'm particularly interested in joining the [specific team] because I see the opportunity to [meaningful contribution]."

### Examples for Major Companies

**Google:**
> "I'm impressed by Google's commitment to open-source (TensorFlow, Kubernetes). I've used these in my projects, and I'd love to contribute to that ecosystem at scale. I'm particularly interested in the Cloud team's work on distributed systems."

**Meta (Facebook):**
> "Meta's focus on supporting creators and communities resonates with me. I saw the announcement about [specific initiative], and the infrastructure challenges around [problem] are exactly what I want to tackle at scale."

**Amazon:**
> "Amazon's commitment to customer obsession and Day 1 mentality appeals to me. I've studied how AWS operates, and the infrastructure challenges around serving millions of users is fascinating."

**Microsoft:**
> "I appreciate Microsoft's pivot toward open-source and cloud-first thinking. The work on [Azure service] aligns with my interest in [technology area]."

## Questions to Ask

This is your chance to assess if the role and company are right for you. **Always have questions ready.**

### Questions for the Recruiter

These are good first-call questions:

1. **About the Role**
   - "What does success look like in the first 90 days?"
   - "What's the team structure and who would I be working with most closely?"
   - "What's the biggest challenge this team is facing right now?"
   - "What's the tech stack and biggest technical debt?"
   - "How much time would be spent on new features vs. maintaining existing systems?"

2. **About the Team**
   - "How large is the team, and what's the growth plan?"
   - "What's the average tenure of people on this team?"
   - "How does the team measure success?"
   - "What's one thing the team is looking to improve?"

3. **About Growth & Development**
   - "What are the career growth opportunities?"
   - "How is professional development supported (conferences, courses, etc.)?"
   - "What does the promotion path look like?"

4. **About the Process**
   - "What are the next steps in the interview process?"
   - "What's the timeline for making a decision?"
   - "How many rounds should I expect?"
   - "What skills are you most focused on evaluating?"

### Questions for the Hiring Manager (if they're on the call)

Save these for later calls, but some can work early:

1. **Technical Questions**
   - "What's your biggest technical challenge right now?"
   - "How does the team approach [relevant technology] at scale?"
   - "What's the oldest part of your codebase and how do you manage it?"

2. **Team Dynamics**
   - "How would you describe your team's culture?"
   - "What do you love most about leading this team?"
   - "How do you handle conflicts within the team?"

3. **Role Specifics**
   - "What would you want me to focus on in my first month?"
   - "What skills are most critical for this role?"

### Avoid These Questions (for intro calls)

- Salary (let them bring it up first, or wait for later conversations)
- Benefits details (too early)
- "Tell me about your company" (you should already know this)
- Anything that shows you didn't research

---

## Red Flags to Watch For

Not every opportunity is the right one. Here are signs to be cautious:

### Company/Role Red Flags

1. **Lack of Clarity on Role**
   - Recruiter can't clearly explain what you'd be doing
   - Role description is vague or overly broad
   - "We'll figure it out when you get here" attitude

2. **High Turnover**
   - "People keep leaving the team" or vague reasons why
   - Multiple people in the role recently
   - Reluctance to discuss why previous candidates didn't work out

3. **Unprofessionalism**
   - Recruiter is late, unprepared, or rude
   - No clear process for interviews
   - Constantly changing requirements or timeline

4. **Unclear Future**
   - Company is in financial trouble
   - Team is being reorganized frequently
   - No clear product/market fit
   - Recent major layoffs without explanation

5. **Toxic Signals**
   - Negative comments about team members
   - "We work hard" repeated without mentioning balance
   - Pressure to commit before seeing role/team
   - Culture described as "very competitive" in a negative way

### Compensation Red Flags

- Refusing to discuss budget range
- Expecting heavy negotiation right away
- Budget is significantly below market rate with no clear reason
- No equity (especially at startups)
- Claiming "high equity, low salary" without showing the math

### People Red Flags

- Recruiter is evasive about manager/team details
- Manager seems unengaged or distracted
- Team members seem unhappy (later calls)
- High-level execs seem disconnected from reality

---

## Salary Expectations & Compensation

**Timing**: Usually discussed after first call or after initial screening.

### Before the Call

1. **Research Your Worth**
   - Check Blind, Levels.fyi, Salary.com, Payscale
   - Account for: location, company, role level, experience
   - Create a salary range (target and bottom line)

2. **Know Your Numbers**
   - Target salary (what you want)
   - Minimum acceptable (walk-away point)
   - Expected bonus %
   - Expected equity grants

3. **Consider Total Compensation**
   - Base salary
   - Signing bonus
   - Annual bonus/RSUs vesting
   - Stock options (startups)
   - Benefits (healthcare, 401k matching, etc.)
   - PTO and flexibility

### When They Ask "What are your salary expectations?"

**Never** say "I don't have a number" or "Whatever is fair". This is a negotiation.

**Good answers:**
- "Based on my research, market rate for this role in [location] with my experience is $180k-$220k. I'm looking for something in that range."
- "I'm looking for $200k+ base. I'm flexible on total comp if equity is strong."
- "I've earned $X in my previous role. I'm looking for growth, so I'm targeting $Y."

**If they ask first:**
- "I want to make sure we're aligned on the role and level first. What's your budget for this position?"
- "What range did you have in mind for this role?"

**Don't:**
- Name a number first (almost always hurts you)
- Anchor low to "be safe"
- Accept the first offer without negotiating
- Ignore equity/RSUs to focus only on base

### Negotiation Tips

1. **Get the full offer in writing first** - Don't negotiate over the phone
2. **Focus on total comp, not just salary** - Signing bonus, equity, etc.
3. **Have leverage** - Ideally you have other offers or aren't desperate
4. **Be data-driven** - Use Levels.fyi, Blind, etc. to justify your ask
5. **Practice saying "no"** - "That's below what I was hoping for. Can we do X?"
6. **Consider your situation** - How much do you need to move? How long can you wait?

### FAANG Typical Ranges (2024 - vary by location and level)

**Senior Software Engineer:**
- Google: $200k-250k base + $100k-150k bonus + $400k-800k equity
- Meta: $210k-240k base + $100k-140k bonus + $500k-1M equity
- Amazon: $170k-200k base + $50k-150k bonus + $300k-800k equity
- Microsoft: $190k-230k base + $50k-100k bonus + $300k-800k equity

**Note:** These are approximate and vary significantly by level, location, and market conditions.

## Timeline & Next Steps

Recruiters should always be clear about timeline. If they're not, that's a red flag.

### Questions to Ask

- "What are the next steps?"
- "What's your timeline for making a decision?"
- "How many rounds should I expect?"
- "What's the feedback timeline after each round?"

## Final Tips

1. **Be Authentic**: Recruiters can tell when you're not being genuine. Be yourself.

2. **Show Growth**: Talk about how you've evolved and what you've learned, not just what you've accomplished.

3. **Ask About Failures**: Many recruiters appreciate honesty. Talking about a project that didn't work out (and what you learned) shows maturity.

4. **Listen More Than You Talk**: Aim for 40% you talking, 60% listening/engaging. Ask follow-up questions.

5. **Be Professional But Human**: You don't have to be robotic. Have a conversation, not an interview.

6. **Trust Your Gut**: If something feels off, it probably is. You're also interviewing them.

7. **Have Backup Offers**: If possible, try to have multiple processes going. It gives you confidence and negotiating power.

8. **Don't Oversell**: Let your experience speak. Don't exaggerate or overclaim.

9. **Follow Up Religiously**: Send thank yous. Follow up on timeline. Small touches matter.

10. **Remember the Human Side**: The recruiter is just doing their job. Be kind and professional. You might work together again one day.
