# Tutorial 05: Service Performance Analysis

## Topics
- Service dependency graphs
- Latency analysis
- Error rate tracking
- Critical path identification
- Performance bottlenecks

## Key Analyses

```
1. Service Dependencies
   - View service map
   - Identify dependencies
   - Analyze call patterns

2. Latency Distribution
   - P50, P95, P99 latencies
   - Compare across services
   - Identify slow operations

3. Error Tracking
   - Error rates by service
   - Error propagation
   - Root cause analysis

4. Critical Path
   - Longest spans in trace
   - Optimization opportunities
   - Parallel vs sequential calls
```
